#Frontend Mentor Advice generator

## The project:

The Advice generator is a straightforward project offered by Frontend Mentor. After just finishing a larger and more involved project I wanted to work on something simpler that I could turn around in a few hours. The advice generator appealed to me as I haven't used APIs in a project for a while, and the mobile and desktop designs were very similar. I wanted to use as little CSS as possible to achieve a responsive design.

## My process:

As I wanted to use as little CSS as possible, I decided to go with grid. I had to use a media query for re-arranging an element and adjusting some text but I'm happy with how little code I used, especially after the media query. Once I had the CSS in place and placeholder text I wrote my JS fetching the data via API. I put some simple error handling in place and snazzed up the green items a little to make it more dynamic.

## Key learning:

The only bit of new tech to me here is CSS clamp. Clamp is pretty amazing and I can see it will save a lot of code in future. I look forward to experimenting with it more on larger projects in the future as makes everything look a lot more professional when re-sizing screens. 

## Final thoughts and takeaway:

While only a small project I'm very pleased with how quickly I turned it around, especially as it involved a bit of research into CSS clamp, refreshing myself on fetching data via API and still getting to grips with grid.
